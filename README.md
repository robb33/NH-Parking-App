# NH-Parking-App
A Peer User Parking App

## Opportunity

Parking is an issue in and around Bucks County. Finding a parking spot in a town's business district can be quite difficult.  This experiment on creating a "Peer Parking App"  Therefore this is a free app that takes no personal information. It is by no means an “official app” built by the borough, the county or the state. The parking spaces are predicated by user input.

## Key Feature(s)
<li>show where parking exist</li>
 	<li>show where parking is available</li>
 	<li>show cost of parking(private lots</li>
 	<li>Use of Geo-Fencing example: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-geo-fencing">https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-geo-fencing</a></li>
</ul>

## Competition

Currently there is no "Peer Parking App".  The only parking app that is available by the borough is <a href="http://us.parkmobile.com/" target="_blank">Park Mobile</a>

## Database Architecture

The app will use MongoDB.

## User Acquisition

Several avenues to promote the app.  There are a couple of site available for the borough, including my own.  Here are the two sites.
